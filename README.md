The project processing involves several key steps:

Text Standardization: The text undergoes a transformation, converting it entirely to either uppercase or lowercase. This normalization ensures that the algorithm treats identical words with different cases as the same.

Tokenization: The text strings are tokenized, breaking them down into a list of meaningful units or tokens. Sentence tokenizer identifies sentences, while word tokenizer identifies individual words within strings. The NLTK data package provides a pre-trained Punkt tokenizer for English.

TF-IDF Approach: This approach involves calculating Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF). TF measures how often a word appears in a document, while IDF assesses the rarity of a word across documents. The TF-IDF score is determined using specific formulas, contributing to the understanding of word importance in the context of the entire document collection.

Cosine Similarity: Cosine similarity is employed to measure the similarity between two non-zero vectors, representing documents. The formula involves the dot product of the vectors divided by the product of their magnitudes. This similarity metric aids in assessing the resemblance between different documents.
